# AI-DLC — one core, many harnesses

This directory contains a native implementation of the AI-DLC (AI-Driven
Development Life Cycle) methodology that ships to many CLI harnesses — today
Claude Code, Kiro CLI, Kiro IDE, Codex CLI, Cursor, opencode, GitHub Copilot, and Devin, and any capable CLI you port it to — from
a single hand-authored source.

## Tenets: the human drives

**Tools for determinism, LLM for knowledge, human for judgement.**

Every design, change, review finding, and question in this repository follows
these three tenets:

- **Tools for determinism.** The engine and hooks do what must be exact and
  repeatable: record that a message arrived through the person's own prompt, in
  order, and not from the agent or a helper (an observed interaction, not proof
  of identity); keep the person's words as the host delivers them; record state
  and the audit trail; mark steps; keep files; and own every chain, token,
  receipt, and part count. Control state lives in the tools, not in the agent's
  memory.
- **LLM for knowledge.** The agent does what needs understanding: reading what
  the person meant from their own words in context, answering their questions,
  applying their instructions, and making the calls that knowledge settles, such
  as how to build what was approved. A directive names the next exact step, and
  the agent runs a command the engine issued exactly as given; it never invents,
  rebuilds, interprets, or holds onto a token beyond that directive, and never
  decides flow by how a sentence of prose ends.
- **Human for judgement.** Where a decision needs judgement, the person makes
  it: what to build, whether the work is right, what to trade off, and when to
  stop. Nothing that knowledge or the tools can settle is put to the person, so
  their attention goes only where they alone can decide. The human drives.

Think of AI-DLC as a software factory the person runs. Scopes are the production
lines, stages are the stations on a line, and agents are the workers at each
station. Workers make the calls their station needs; the person makes the
judgement calls. Guards protect the person from workers doing the wrong thing;
they never stand between the person and what the person asks for.

The engine exists to enforce the will of the human, never to overrule it. When
the person explicitly asks for something, the flow does it and says in one line
what happened: no confirmation question unless the action cannot be undone and
is not what they asked for, no re-asking what they already said, and no refusal
that puts the engine's rules ahead of their words. Follow up only when their
intent is genuinely unclear. Gates exist to collect the person's judgement, so
when the person decides (approve, change, skip, jump, or switch a check off),
the flow records that decision through its own mechanism instead of refusing
it. An explicit request means the person's own words, never the agent's account
of them. Exact answers such as "Approve", an option number, or a slash command
are shortcuts the tools may read; anything else is the agent's to understand. A
tool that judges the meaning of a person's words, or that second-guesses an
explicit request, is a defect, however safe it looks.

**Guards.** A guard is a deterministic check over recorded facts, aimed at an
agent's action, never at a person's message. Its refusal names the exact next
step. The person's plain request lifts it, and the lift is recorded with their
words. When a guard or tool loses its own coordination bookkeeping (a claim on a
command, a busy lock, a project-identity hash that no longer matches), it fails
toward the person's last recorded instruction with a one-line note, never into a
re-ask, a refusal, or a loop with no way out. Evidence that selects or binds a
human decision (an approval record, the plan fingerprint, the marker naming the
approved target) is different: it never falls back to a guess. Its owning
mechanism decides whether the approval still holds (for Plan Approval, the
contract in `docs/reference/06-hooks-and-tools.md`, "Plan-Approval Guard
Hook"), and the flow never loops on it and never asks the person to approve
again what that mechanism says still holds.

**One owner per rule.** Every invariant (approval, transition, presence, the
plan fingerprint) has one owner and one shared check. Enforcing that check at
several boundaries (a hook for fast feedback, a command-line floor where hooks
cannot run) is fine; a second, independently written version of the same rule
is a defect, however safe it looks.

**Prior judgement.** A setting the team explicitly locked (for example a strict
Guard Policy held in memory) and an unattended run are human judgement already
made, and they outrank one person's chat request. The flow says in one line that
it is locked, where, and that changing that file changes it; it never loops or
refuses silently. Defaults are not locks: the person can change a scope, a
ceremony, a per-intent setting, or the conversation language whenever they ask.

## Project Structure

- `core/` — **The hand-authored, harness-neutral source of truth.** Tools, stages (`aidlc-common/`), agents, memory (the rule/method layer), scopes, sensors, knowledge, hooks, and the 3 session skills. Prose names the harness directory with the `{{HARNESS_DIR}}` token; the packager substitutes `.claude`/`.kiro`/`.codex`/`.aidlc`/`.cursor` per tree.
- `harness/<name>/` — **The thin per-harness authored surface.** Each holds `manifest.ts` (how to project `core/` into that harness's dist) plus the orchestrator skill and harness-specific files; `harness/codex/`, `harness/opencode/`, `harness/copilot/`, and `harness/devin/` add an `emit.ts` (per-shell emissions). `claude/`, `kiro/`, `kiro-ide/`, `codex/`, `cursor/`, `opencode/`, `copilot/`, `devin/`.
- `plugins/<name>/` — **Optional, owned AIDLC plugins** (the plugin mechanism; design in the single chapter `docs/reference/18-plugin-mechanism.md`, authoring guide `docs/harness-engineering/10-authoring-a-plugin.md`). Each holds `.aidlc-plugin/plugin.json` (the declarative manifest) + core-shaped subtrees (`stages/`, `contributions/`, `sensors/`, `tools/`, …) + `tests/`. `bun scripts/package.ts` emits a real host plugin per harness at `dist/plugins/<name>/{claude,codex,copilot,cursor,kiro,kiro-ide,opencode}/`; a compose hook merges the plugin into an install (new stages + the additive contribution seam). Plugins add, the install selects: `tools/data/harness.json` `plugins` filters the enabled graph/scope/runner surfaces while keeping installed files re-enableable. `plugins/test-pro/` is the reference fixture. Guarded by `tests/integration/t188-plugin-compose.serial.test.ts` (mechanism) + `plugins/test-pro/tests/` (content, wired into the integration tier).
- `scripts/package.ts` — **The build entry.** `bun scripts/package.ts` materializes every local `dist/<harness>/` and `dist-release/<harness>/`; `bun scripts/package.ts --check` builds twice in independent temp roots and byte-compares the results as the determinism guard. `manifest-types.ts` is the shared manifest contract.
- `dist/` and `dist-release/` — **GENERATED, ignored local outputs.** They are never committed or hand-edited. CI, tests, binary builds, and release packaging regenerate them before use. Native users install release assets; copy-channel users take `runtime/<harness>/` from the versioned `aidlc-runtime.tar.gz` release asset.
- `tests/` — All-TypeScript test suite (`t*.test.ts`, run via bun), four levels (smoke/unit/integration/e2e). Run `bash tests/run-tests.sh --help` for levels and profiles.
- `docs/guide/` — User Guide: getting started, workflows, scopes, agents, customization, troubleshooting
- `docs/harness-engineering/` — Harness Engineer Guide: reshaping AIDLC through configuration (stages, agents, scopes, rules, sensors, knowledge) without code, plus porting AIDLC to a new harness
- `docs/reference/` — Developer Reference: architecture, orchestrator, stage protocol, hooks, testing, contributing

## How It Works

The hand-authored source lives in `core/` (harness-neutral) + `harness/<name>/`
(per-CLI surfaces); `bun scripts/package.ts` regenerates the `dist/<harness>/`
trees. The core uses the same building blocks in every harness:

- **Skills** (`skills/aidlc/`) — Orchestrator (`SKILL.md`), stage protocol, and 33 stage files across 5 phases (initialization, ideation, inception, construction, operation)
- **Agents** (`agents/`) — 14 `aidlc-<role>-agent.md` files: 11 domain-expert personas (product, design, delivery, architect, aws-platform, compliance, devsecops, developer, quality, pipeline-deploy, operations), 2 review-only agents (product-lead, architecture-reviewer), and the adaptive-workflows composer (aidlc-composer-agent)
- **Method/rules** (`memory/`) — Layered config in the space memory layer: `org.md` (framework defaults), `team.md` (affirmed practices), `project.md` (project overrides), and `phases/<phase>.md` for ideation/inception/construction/operation
- **Sensors** (`sensors/`) — Deterministic verification manifests (advisory): `aidlc-claim-sources.md`, `aidlc-required-sections.md`, `aidlc-upstream-coverage.md`, `aidlc-traceability.md`, `aidlc-linter.md`, `aidlc-type-check.md`
- **Knowledge** (`knowledge/`) — Methodology reference. Per-agent under `aidlc-<agent>-agent/`; cross-agent material in `aidlc-shared/`
- **Tools** (`tools/`) — TypeScript CLI tools, all prefixed `aidlc-*.ts` and run via bun
- **Hooks** (`hooks/`) — 17 framework hooks, all prefixed `aidlc-*.ts`, covering audit emission, sensor dispatch, stage-graph rebuild, session lifecycle, state validation, subagent tracking, statusline rendering, human-turn recording, exact stage-rule delivery, forwarding-loop enforcement, reviewer read-scope enforcement, review-receipt write-freeze enforcement, code-generation plan-approval enforcement, direct state-transition enforcement, and token-usage folding (the Claude-only usage-ledger producer)

## Working on This Project

- **Edit `core/` (or `harness/<name>/`), never `dist*`.** After editing, run `bun scripts/package.ts` to materialize local projections and `bun scripts/package.ts --check` to confirm the generator emits byte-identical results from two clean builds.
- **Markdown block structure has one interpreter:** `markdownBlocks` in `core/tools/aidlc-lib.ts`, backed by the built-in `Bun.markdown` renderer, supplies block visibility, containers, link reference definitions, and claim-splitting structure; `visibleMarkdownLines` projects it. Do not add a Markdown dependency, another block scanner, or a definition grammar. The security-sensitive `Bun.markdown.render` review-authority check is a deliberately separate code path.
- The orchestrator skill (`harness/<name>/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md`) is per-harness; the engine and methodology live in `core/`.
- User-facing onboarding uses two skeletons: `core/templates/onboarding.md` is marker-free neutral guidance; `core/templates/onboarding-harness.md` carries each harness's `onboarding.fills.ts`. Edit the neutral template for shared project guidance and the harness skeleton/fills for native setup. Kiro, Kiro IDE, Codex, Cursor, and opencode share byte-identical root `AGENTS.md` content and ship native onboarding inside their harness directories; Claude concatenates both parts in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and Copilot in its exclusive root `AGENTS.md`.
- "harness" has three senses in this repo: `harness/` (top-level, the per-CLI distribution surfaces — this effort), `docs/harness-engineering/` (the Harness Engineer Guide), and `tests/harness/` (test-suite helper library) — unrelated.
- See `docs/guide/` (User Guide), `docs/harness-engineering/` (Harness Engineer Guide), and `docs/reference/` (Developer Reference) for full documentation

## Test Suite

Run `bash tests/run-tests.sh --help` for levels and flags. See `docs/reference/09-testing.md` for full strategy.

## Utility Handler Checklist

See `docs/reference/11-contributing.md` § "Adding a Utility Handler" before implementing a new `/aidlc --*` command.

## Documentation Policy

IMPORTANT: When adding, removing, or renaming files, directories, commands, or flags — grep `docs/` and `README.md` for stale references and update them in the same commit.

## Release Metadata Policy

IMPORTANT: Feature, fix, documentation, refactor, and test PRs do NOT bump `core/tools/aidlc-version.ts`, change the README version badge, or add a release entry to `CHANGELOG.md`. Those coordinated updates belong to the release-preparation PR, which summarizes the user-visible changes merged since the previous release. Every PR must preserve existing changelog entries.

The release-preparation PR updates `core/tools/aidlc-version.ts` (the authored source; the per-harness `dist/<harness>/.../tools/aidlc-version.ts` copies are regenerated by `bun scripts/package.ts`), the README badge, and a matching `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading in `CHANGELOG.md` in the same commit. The pin in `tests/unit/t68-version-changelog-sync.test.ts` enforces that these three release surfaces agree and that changelog headings remain unique.

Each release entry follows the shape: `## [N.N.N] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading, one-paragraph summary that includes any upgrade instruction, then a flat bullet list focused on what users actually invoke (commands, flags, errors they see, breaking changes for CI/scripts).

If concurrent release-preparation branches choose the same version, the later one must rebase and select the next intended release version before merging. CHANGELOG version link references were removed in v0.6.9 because a distributed file should not embed a repository host; `t68` guards that none reappear.
