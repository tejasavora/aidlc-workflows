// harness/cursor/manifest.ts — the Cursor distribution row.
//
// Projects the harness-neutral core/ tree into dist/cursor/.cursor/. Cursor is
// the most "native" port so far: unlike opencode (engine hidden in .aidlc/) or
// codex (skills composed by emit.ts), Cursor consumes the standard projection
// directly — no emit.ts at all.
//
// Cursor specifics vs Claude (all live-verified against cursor-agent
// 2026.07.23 on Linux; the IDE shares the same .cursor/ discovery):
//   - token → .cursor. Cursor scans ONLY .cursor/rules/, .cursor/agents/,
//     .cursor/skills/, .cursor/commands/, .cursor/hooks.json, .cursor/mcp.json
//     and .cursor/cli.json for native meaning; the engine dirs (tools/,
//     aidlc-common/, knowledge/, sensors/, scopes/, hooks/) are inert data to
//     Cursor and safely share the directory.
//   - the 14 core persona .md files in .cursor/agents/ ARE live native
//     subagents: Cursor's agent frontmatter (name/description/model) is a
//     subset of core's and unknown keys are tolerated (live-verified with the
//     full core frontmatter incl. display_name/examples/disallowedTools).
//     The task tool targets them by name — no emitted twins.
//   - skills: .cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md is Cursor's native skill layout,
//     invoked as /<name> with inline argument forwarding (live-verified). The
//     generated stage runners land there via the standard runner-gen step;
//     three authored utility skills add /aidlc-status, /aidlc-jump, and
//     /aidlc-scope without relying on Cursor's legacy commands directory.
//   - rules: Cursor loads ONLY .mdc files with frontmatter from
//     .cursor/rules/ (a plain .md there is ignored, and @-import lines do NOT
//     expand — both live-verified). The method include is therefore split:
//     rules/aidlc.mdc always carries org/team/project, while four agent-decided
//     phase pointers keep phase guidance relevant (live-verified: a phase
//     question loads only the matching phase rule; an off-topic prompt loads
//     none). The sessionStart hook injects the live workflow context.
//   - hooks: .cursor/hooks.json wires camelCase events (matcher-free; the
//     adapter self-filters) to aidlc-cursor-adapter.ts, which normalizes
//     payloads and subprocess-pipes into the byte-shared core hooks.
