// harness/copilot/manifest.ts — the GitHub Copilot distribution row.
//
// ONE dist serves BOTH Copilot surfaces — Copilot CLI (1.0.74+) and VS Code
// agent mode (1.130+) — because GitHub converged them on the same project
// discovery paths: .github/skills/, .github/agents/, .github/hooks/, and the
// root AGENTS.md are read identically by both (compat spike, 10 live CLI
// probes + IDE parser extraction in the compatibility-spike evidence). Splitting
// cli/ide harnesses would ship two dists competing for the
// same .github file paths; the divergences are authoring rules instead:
//   - hooks registered under PascalCase event names → BOTH surfaces deliver
//     Claude-shaped snake_case payloads (one adapter path);
//   - agent `tools:` uses the UNION vocabulary (each surface silently ignores
//     the other's names — live-verified, no fallback-to-all);
//   - agents carry NO `model:` field (the CLI forwards IDE display names
//     verbatim to the BYOK provider → live-verified 400; tierFlavor copilot
//     is model-omitted by type).
//
// Copilot specifics vs Claude:
//   - token → .aidlc, NOT .copilot or .github. Project-level .copilot/ is not
//     a documented discovery root (only ~/.copilot has COPILOT_HOME
//     semantics), and .github/ is SHARED with real repo content (workflows,
//     templates) — the engine tree cannot own it. The engine ships at
//     .aidlc/ — a dir neither Copilot surface scans (the opencode precedent)
//     — and emit.ts writes only aidlc-named files into .github/.
//   - .github/ carries ONLY natively-consumed emissions (emit.ts): the hook
//     wiring (.github/hooks/aidlc.json → the adapter in .aidlc/hooks/), the
//     14 persona agents (.github/agents/aidlc-*-agent.md), and the full
//     skills tree (.github/skills/: orchestrator + generated runners +
//     session skills — Copilot discovers project skills there, so the
//     standard <harnessDir>/skills/ runner-gen step is skipped).
//   - Copilot auto-reads the project-root AGENTS.md (both surfaces).
//   - An .aidlc runtime dir is ALSO what the opencode harness ships; an
//     install is disambiguated by its wiring files (.github/hooks/aidlc.json
//     + .aidlc/hooks/aidlc-copilot-adapter.ts here vs .opencode/plugin/
//     there) — the doctor probes exactly that.
