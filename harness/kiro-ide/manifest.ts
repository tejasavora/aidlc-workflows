// harness/kiro-ide/manifest.ts — the Kiro distribution row for Kiro's unified
// agent harness, which Kiro IDE 1.x and Kiro CLI v3 both run and both read
// from the same .kiro/ tree.
//
//   - Agents ship as Markdown only. The conductor is an authored aidlc.md;
//     persona files come from core and receive native tools/permissions.
//   - settings/cli.json pins Kiro CLI to the v3 engine and to the aidlc agent.
//     The default v2 engine runs no .kiro/hooks at all, and a hook cannot
//     detect that from inside, so the pin is the only guard. Kiro IDE does not
//     read this file.
//   - Always-included steering preloads the active-space memory tree.
//   - Hooks ship as v1 .kiro/hooks/*.json only; both surfaces register them at
//     session start. IDE 0.x .kiro.hook files are not shipped: IDE 1.x never
//     executes them.
