// harness/opencode/manifest.ts — the opencode distribution row.
//
// Projects the harness-neutral core/ tree into dist/opencode/.aidlc/ and defers
// every opencode-native surface to emit.ts (the .opencode/ shell: subagent .md
// files, the /aidlc command, the hook-adapter plugin). Verified live against
// opencode 1.17.18.
//
// opencode specifics vs Claude:
//   - token → .aidlc, NOT .opencode. opencode auto-imports every *.ts under
//     .opencode/tools/ and .opencode/tool/ as custom tool definitions
//     (live-verified: a CLI-style script there crashes the session), so the
//     engine tree cannot live inside .opencode/. It ships at .aidlc/ — a dir
//     opencode never scans — and the shipped opencode.json registers
//     `skills.paths: [".aidlc/skills"]` so skills are discovered there
//     (live-verified).
//   - .opencode/ carries ONLY natively-consumed emissions (emit.ts): the 14
//     persona subagents (.opencode/agents/*.md, mode: subagent + projected
//     tier keys), the /aidlc command (.opencode/command/aidlc.md), and the
//     hook-adapter plugin (.opencode/plugin/aidlc-opencode-adapter.ts, the
//     auto-discovered plugin seam mapping opencode hook moments onto the core
//     hook bodies in .aidlc/hooks/).
//   - the method tree reaches ambient context via the `instructions` glob in
//     the shipped opencode.json ("aidlc/spaces/default/memory/**/*.md",
//     live-verified) — opencode's native include surface, re-pointed on a
//     space switch by aidlc-includes.ts.
//   - opencode auto-reads the project-root AGENTS.md (its primary rules file).
