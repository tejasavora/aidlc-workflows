// harness/kiro/manifest.ts — the Kiro CLI distribution row.
//
// Projects the harness-neutral core/ tree into dist/kiro/.kiro/, plus Kiro's
// authored shell surfaces (orchestrator skill, agent JSON configs, the stdin
// adapter hook, settings/cli.json, AGENTS.md). Mirrors the proven
// package-kiro.ts spike, generalized onto the unified packager.
//
// Kiro specifics vs Claude:
//   - token → .kiro
//   - rules/ → steering/ (Kiro auto-loads steering; rules ARE the always-on
//     layer)
//   - the orchestrator skill is per-harness (authored here, NOT core), so it
//     is NOT in coreDirs — only the 3 session skills are.
//   - agents/ is MIXED: the persona .md files are core (copied + rules rename
//     n/a), the Kiro-native agent .json configs are authored (harnessFiles).
//   - hooks/ is MIXED: core hook bodies are copied; the one authored
//     aidlc-kiro-adapter.ts stdin shim is a harnessFile.
//   - AGENTS.md lands at the PROJECT ROOT (dist/kiro/AGENTS.md), outside .kiro/.

  // Kiro CLI's engines read disjoint hook registrations. This tree registers
  // its hooks in the agent JSON `hooks` block, which the v2 engine runs while
  // the aidlc agent is active. The v3 engine (KAS) reads no agent-v1 JSON and
  // runs only `.kiro/hooks/*.json` v2 files, so on v3 no hook fires and a
  // restart on the same engine changes nothing. Measured on kiro-cli 2.21.1
  // over ACP for #1487: v2 7 heartbeats and a HUMAN_TURN, `--agent-engine v3`
  // none, with or without client hooks enabled. The advice names v2 rather
  // than "the default": a user setting (`chat.agentEngine`) or a later Kiro
  // release can make v3 the default, and `kiro-cli --help` already calls v2
  // "the pre-3.0 default". Kiro's own upgrade (`/upgrade-agent`, or "Switch to
  // 3.0 and upgrade my configs") rewrites the agent JSON into a universal
  // format whose hooks v3 does run and v2 still runs (measured on kiro-cli
  // 2.23.1), so the text says v3 does not run the file as shipped; the v2
  // advice holds either way, because v2 runs both formats.
  // Measured live: with another agent picked, `/agent` and aidlc bring the
  // hooks back in the same chat; on the 3.0 engine only a start on v2 does,
  // and Kiro then prints its own `agent "aidlc" needs upgrading for this agent
  // engine` line under every reply, which tells the two apart. Its
  // execute_bash hooks (review-freeze, plan-approval-guard) beat in the record
  // before each engine command, ahead of their own off switches.
