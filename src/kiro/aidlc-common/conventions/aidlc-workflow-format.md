# Workflow File Format

The workflow file is `workflow.md` in the intent directory. It is a simple text file — one skill invocation per line. Each line contains the skill name followed by input file paths separated by spaces.

```
<skill-name> <input-file-1> [<input-file-2> ...]
```

For construction-phase skills with `per-unit: "true"` that execute per-unit, add `--unit <unit-name>` after the skill name:

```
<skill-name> --unit <unit-name> <input-file-1> [<input-file-2> ...]
```

When `--unit` is present:
- Artifacts are written to `construction/<unit-name>/<skill-name>/` instead of `inception/<skill-name>/`
- The state key becomes `<skill-name>:<unit-name>` so the same skill can run independently for different units

For skills outside the inception phase that don't use `--unit`, add `--phase <phase-name>` after the skill name to route artifacts to the correct subtree:

```
<skill-name> --phase <phase-name> <input-file-1> [<input-file-2> ...]
```

When `--phase` is present:
- Artifacts are written to `<phase-name>/<skill-name>/` instead of the default `inception/<skill-name>/`
- Use this for `bootstrap` and `operations` skills

For skills that run multiple times within the same phase against different scopes (e.g., reverse-engineering one repo at a time), add `--scope <scope-name>` after the skill name:

```
<skill-name> --scope <scope-name> <input-file-1> [<input-file-2> ...]
```

When `--scope` is present:
- Artifacts are written to `<phase>/<skill-name>/<scope-name>/` instead of `<phase>/<skill-name>/`
- The state key becomes `<skill-name>:<scope-name>` so the same skill can run independently for different scopes
- `--scope` is phase-agnostic — it adds a subdirectory within whatever phase the skill belongs to

`--scope` is mandatory for `reverse-engineering` (always scoped to a repo name, even with a single repo).

For pack skills that need to identify their owning pack and route artifacts to pack-specific output paths, add `--pack <pack-name>` after the skill name:

```
<skill-name> --pack <pack-name> <input-file-1> [<input-file-2> ...]
```

`--pack` can be combined with `--unit` or `--phase` (but not `--scope`):

```
<skill-name> --unit <unit-name> --pack <pack-name> <input-file-1> [<input-file-2> ...]
<skill-name> --phase <phase-name> --pack <pack-name> <input-file-1> [<input-file-2> ...]
```

When `--pack` is present:
- Identifies which extension pack this skill belongs to (e.g., `quality-gates`, `operations`, `well-architected`, `resilience`)
- Determines the artifact output subdirectory within the phase tree:
  - `quality-gates` pack skills (per-unit): `construction/<unit>/quality/<skill-name>/`
  - `operations` pack skills: `operations/<skill-name>/`
  - `well-architected` pack skills: `construction/well-architected/<skill-name>/`
  - `resilience` pack skills: `operations/resilience/<skill-name>/`
  - Other packs: `<phase>/<pack-name>/<skill-name>/`
- The state key becomes `<skill-name>:<pack-name>` when the same skill name could exist in multiple packs
- Pack metadata in `SKILL.md` frontmatter (`pack: <pack-name>`) is authoritative; `--pack` in `workflow.md` is the runtime signal to the orchestrator confirming which pack is active for this invocation

`--pack` without `--unit` or `--phase` uses the skill's declared `phase` from its frontmatter.

`--phase`, `--unit`, and `--scope` are mutually exclusive with each other. `--pack` is additive and can be combined with `--unit` or `--phase`. `--unit` implies `construction`. `--scope` preserves the skill's declared phase.

Lines starting with `#` are comments. Empty lines are ignored.

## Bootstrap skills are not in workflow.md

`workflow.md` lists only downstream skills (inception, construction, operations). The two bootstrap skills (`intent-bootstrap` and `workflow-composition`) run via the orchestrator's bootstrap pre-loop and are never present in `workflow.md`:

- `intent-bootstrap` runs before `workflow.md` exists; it creates the file with one stub line for `workflow-composition`.
- `workflow-composition` reads that stub, then rewrites `workflow.md` from scratch with the chosen downstream skills.

By the time `process_checker` reads `workflow.md` to drive the standard skill loop, both bootstrap skills are already complete and the file contains only downstream skill lines.

## File extension

The file **must** be named `workflow.md`. `process_checker` looks for this exact filename.
