//
// t01 — shipped-tree file-structure invariant. Migrated from
// tests/smoke/t01-file-structure.sh (TAP plan 63, 63 distinct file-existence
// assertions). The .sh resolved CLAUDE_DIR = dist/claude/.claude and ran
// assert_file_exists on each of the 63 paths the framework ships.
//
// Mechanism: none. This is a pure structural check — does each shipped path
// exist on disk under the distributable .claude/ tree? No process boundary, no
// argv/exit/stdout seam, no LLM, zero tokens. We resolve the same tree the .sh
// resolved via the harness's AIDLC_SRC (= <repo>/dist/claude/.claude,
// fixtures.ts:42) and assert existsSync() in-process. AIDLC_SRC is the TS
// canonical for the .sh's `cd .../dist/claude/.claude && pwd` CLAUDE_DIR.
//
// Subject under test: the shipped layout of dist/claude/.claude/ — the bytes a
// user copies into their project's .claude/. Verified present on disk this
// session (every path below `ls`-confirmed against the worktree's dist tree).
//

//   .sh L38-40  3 initialization stages (loop)         -> "ships the 3 initialization stages"
//   .sh L43-45  7 ideation stages (loop)               -> "ships the 7 ideation stages"
