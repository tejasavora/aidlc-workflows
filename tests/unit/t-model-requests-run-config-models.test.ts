// A person asks in plain words, with no /aidlc, to change an agent's model or
// effort ("make the developer agent think harder"). The agent used to edit the
// projected agent file by hand: `config models --check` then reported drift,
// and the next `aidlc config` put the old value back. Every harness's ambient
// onboarding and its /aidlc skill now name the `config models` command, and no
// doc tells anyone to edit the projected file.
