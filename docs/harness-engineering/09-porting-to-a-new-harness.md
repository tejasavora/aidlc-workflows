# Porting AI-DLC to a New Harness

AI-DLC ships from **one core, many harnesses** — today Claude Code, Kiro CLI, Kiro IDE,
Codex CLI, Cursor, opencode, GitHub Copilot, and Devin, and the set is open. The hand-authored source is a
harness-neutral `core/` plus a thin `harness/<name>/` surface per CLI; the
packager (`scripts/package.ts`) materializes each ignored local Bun copy tree
under `dist/<harness>/` and its native counterpart under
`dist-release/<harness>/`. Adding another harness is **one directory and one
manifest row** — the engine, methodology, projection ownership, and
harness-dir/rules resolution take no `core/` edits at all; the lone optional
exception is a per-harness `--doctor` arm (see Step 2). This page walks the
contract.

> Three senses of "harness" in this repo: **`harness/`** (top-level — the
> per-CLI distribution surfaces this page is about), **`docs/harness-engineering/`**
> (this guide), and **`tests/harness/`** (the test-suite helper library).
> Unrelated; only the first is a distribution.

```

`core/` prose names the harness directory with `{{HARNESS_DIR}}`, calls the
framework through `{{INVOKE}}`, and uses `{{TOOL_PREFIX}}` where a generated
prefix is required. The packager substitutes the declared directory plus one of
two invocation policies:

| Channel | `{{INVOKE}}` | `{{TOOL_PREFIX}}` |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| `dist/` | `bun <harness-dir>/tools/aidlc.ts` | `bun <harness-dir>/tools/` |
| `dist-release/` | `aidlc` | `aidlc ` |

The transform applies to Markdown and structured command surfaces
(`.json`/`.toml`/`.hook`), and to invocation tokens in TypeScript; it is not a
general source rewrite. The runtime `harnessDir()` seam in
`core/tools/aidlc-lib.ts` still derives the directory from the shipped layout
(open-set: the tool's own path, not a hardcoded list), so the same authored tool
sources run in every tree. The acceptance gate is **generator determinism**:
`package.ts --check` builds both channels and every plugin projection twice in
independent temporary roots, then byte-compares the complete outputs. It does
not read local `dist/` or `dist-release/`.

The packager **discovers** harnesses by scanning `harness/` for a `manifest.ts`,
so a new dir is built by the default `bun scripts/package.ts` and `--check` with
no edit to the packager itself — the literal meaning of "one directory and one
manifest row, zero shared-code edits."

## Step 1 — the manifest (the declarative 80%)

Create `harness/<name>/manifest.ts` exporting a `HarnessManifest`
(`scripts/manifest-types.ts`). The fields:

- `name` / `harnessDir` — the dir the token substitutes to (e.g. `.foo`).
- `productName` / `configNextStep` — user-facing projection metadata consumed by
  lifecycle and `aidlc config`; keep host commands exact.
- `firstRunSteps` / `editorTerminalApp` / `hookActivation` (optional) - only for
  a host whose first run needs steps the other harnesses do not. `firstRunSteps`
  replaces the two next-step lines that end `aidlc config`. `editorTerminalApp`
  is the `TERM_PROGRAM` value the editor's built-in terminal sets; running
  `aidlc config` there makes this harness the wizard's default choice.
  `hookActivation` is for a host that may run no hooks until the person acts.
  Every text in it names only the person's own step, in the host's own words,
  never hooks, the engine, or why; `<entry>`, `<folder>` and `<next>` are
  filled in for the install (`<next>` is the engine's `next` command; in
  `next`'s stop it is fixed words saying to run the stopped command again, so
  its request is kept). `recovery` is doctor's fix. Set
  `agentStep` only when a hook on the agent's own shell command leaves a
  heartbeat in the record before the engine runs, even with its own check
  switched off: it says what the agent does itself and quotes the exact line it
  then shows the person.
  `next` then stops with it as a `print` before any work once a stage has
  started with no heartbeat at all, and in that same state the attended "no
  new human reply" refusal carries it with "do not ask them to answer again".
  Otherwise, or for a harness without `agentStep`, that refusal gives
  `missedReply` instead (an `AIDLC_UNATTENDED=1`
  run gets its own explanation), worded for a person who may not have replied
  yet ("If the person already replied, ..."). Set `notRunYet` only when the
  harness's hooks leave a heartbeat on every chat message, the first one before
  any workflow included (the human-turn hook does, and so do the Copilot and
  Kiro IDE adapters); doctor then warns with that text while no heartbeat
  exists, and with `agentStep` the first `next` stops with the agent's step
  when the person's message left none, before any work. Set `notRunInWorkflow` only
  with `agentStep`: when the person has switched the presence check off, so
  `next` does not stop, the engine adds that sentence to every directive's
  `change_notices` instead. Claude Code, Codex CLI, Kiro CLI and opencode
  declare `recovery`, `agentStep` and `notRunYet`; Copilot also
  `notRunInWorkflow`; Kiro IDE `recovery`,
  `missedReply` and `notRunYet`, and keeps its agent's step in its
  orchestrator skill, since in a folder Kiro has not been allowed to run
  commands in no AI-DLC command can run.
- `directiveMaxBytes` (optional) - for a host that keeps less of one shell
  result than the engine's 28 KiB directive cap. The engine keeps every
  directive at or under it: stage rules ride inline only while they fit, and
  load-steering parts are cut to fit. Size it below the host's cut with room for
  the trailing newline (a UTF-8 byte count is never below the character count).
  Only Copilot declares it (19,000 bytes, for VS Code's 20,000-character
  terminal result). A native engine also applies it to projects configured by an
  older release, from the runtime it ships, never lets a project's own value
  exceed it, and in a project with several harnesses installed the smallest
  declared limit wins. When a step cannot fit,
  the error names the host from a fixed list keyed by harness name
  (`HOST_LABELS` in `core/tools/aidlc-runtime-paths.ts`), never from the
  project-editable `productName`; add your harness there, or it reads "this
  assistant".
- `rootIntegrations` — every project-root file emitted by the normal projection,
  each with an explicit init merge policy (`managed-block`, `json-map`,
  `json-array`, `whole-file`, or `jsonc-settings`). `jsonc-settings` is for an
  editor's own JSONC settings file (Copilot's `.vscode/settings.json`): config
  adds each shipped top-level key only when the project does not set it, never
  changes a value someone else set, keeps every other key, comment, and line,
  records the keys it added so a key the team later removes is not added back,
  and retires only a key whose value is still the one it added. The copy
  runtime leaves such a file out, so copying never replaces the team's own.
  Declare marker/JSON identity, optionality, and
  exact legacy adoption hashes here. The packager rejects an emitted top-level
  entry that is neither a managed directory nor a declared root integration.
  `shared: "union"` combines managed-block line sets across installed harnesses.
  `shared: "identical"` declares byte-identical content that any declaring harness
  may own, so two harnesses shipping it can coexist; absent `shared`, the block is exclusive.
- `nativeRootIntegrations` (optional) — release-channel-only root files, such as
  a trust seed, with the same merge contract plus an authored `src`.
- `tierFlavor` — selects the existing Claude/Codex/Kiro/OpenCode agent
  model/effort projection shape. It is manifest data, never inferred from
  `name`.
- `kiroLayout` (Kiro rows only) — `agent-v1` (JSON agents carrying their hooks)
  or `kas` (Markdown agents and standalone `.kiro/hooks/*.json`, which Kiro IDE
  1.x and Kiro CLI v3 run). It is written to `harness.json`, and runtime code
  that depends on the layout reads it from the installed tree rather than from
  `name`.
- `coreDirs: DirMap[]` — which `core/<src>` dirs project into `<harnessDir>/<dst>`.
  Rename or drop dirs here (Kiro `rules → steering`; Codex `rules → aidlc-rules`
  and drops `skills/` — see emit). The 3 session skills are core dirs for
  in-tree harnesses (claude, kiro, kiro-ide); codex emits them instead.
- `harnessFiles: FileMap[]` — authored surfaces copied verbatim from
  `harness/<name>/<src>` into each channel (supported text formats get token
  substitution).
  `projectRoot: true` lands a file beside the harness dir (e.g. `AGENTS.md`).
- `orchestratorSkillPath` (optional) — project-root-relative path to the
  assembled orchestrator `SKILL.md`. It defaults to
  `<harnessDir>/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md`; declare it for emit-owned layouts outside
  that tree, such as `.agents/skills/aidlc/SKILL.md`.
- `frontmatterAdditions` (optional) - per-file YAML lines appended to a
  core-projected `.md`'s frontmatter during projection, for a harness-NATIVE
  field that must not ship to other harnesses (kiro-ide injects
  `tools: ["read", "write", "shell"]` into its delegation-target agent files -
  the IDE reads subagent tool grants from the `.md` frontmatter). Declared as
  manifest data so core stays single-source; the packager errors on a typo'd
  path, a missing frontmatter block, or a key core already declares.
- `nativeReplacements` (optional) — exact `{ from, to }` text the release
  channel swaps in before its generic invocation rewrite, for projected content
  whose copy-channel spelling has no mechanical native form (kiro-ide's persona
  shell deny). The packager errors when a `from` is absent from the projection,
  and its projected-invocation check skips the `to` text, which is generated
  from the route table.
- `rulesRename` — the renamed rules dir (`"steering"` | `"aidlc-rules"` | `null`).
  The packager applies it to the copied dir AND to in-prose `<harnessDir>/rules/`
  references AND to the compiled stage-graph rule paths (it sets
  `AIDLC_RULES_DIR` at compile so `loadRules` finds the renamed dir) AND emits it
  into a generated `tools/data/harness.json` that records both the manifest
  name and rules directory. Runtime path resolution uses the name to
  disambiguate harnesses that share an engine directory, while `rulesSubdir()`
  reads the rename — so a real install resolves both facts without hardcoding.
  This is the seam that makes `rulesRename` purely manifest data: set it here and
  every layer (build prose, compiled paths, runtime) follows, with no `core/` edit.
- `onboarding: OnboardingSpec` — render neutral guidance from
  `core/templates/onboarding.md` and harness-specific setup from
  `core/templates/onboarding-harness.md` with `harness/<name>/onboarding.fills.ts`.
  `dst` names the output; `projectRoot: true` places it beside the engine directory.
  Set `harnessDst` to a tree-root-relative native onboarding path to keep `dst`
  neutral-only and emit the filled harness skeleton separately. Without
  `harnessDst`, both parts are concatenated (native first, one blank line between),
  as Claude and Copilot require. The native skeleton's leading `frontmatter` slot
  supports always-on steering/rules; the neutral skeleton must contain no markers.
  The packager verifies byte identity for every `shared: "identical"` root path.
  Use `null` only when `emit.ts` owns onboarding or no onboarding ships.
- `skipRunnerGen` — set when the harness ships no `<harnessDir>/skills/` (Codex
  emits its skill tree to `.agents/skills/` via `emit`); the packager then skips
  the standard runner-gen step.
- `emit` — the optional plugin (Step 3), `null` for harnesses that need none.
- `plugin` (optional) — the host plugin manifest directory and delivery kind.
  Omitting it derives `<harnessDir>-plugin` plus store delivery; set `kind:
  "kiro"` only for a folder-drop host.

Claude's manifest is the minimal reference (no rename, no emit); Kiro's adds a
rename + `harnessFiles` (agent JSONs and adapter) plus split root/native onboarding;
Codex demonstrates native-only root integration and imperative emission.

The packager writes `tools/data/harness.json`, `aidlc-stamp.json`, and
`aidlc-projection.json` from these fields. The first is runtime configuration;
the stamp identifies version/distribution/harness; the projection descriptor is
the install ownership contract. Its optional project-relative `onboarding` path
identifies the native file diagnostics tracks (absent when onboarding is the root
file). `aidlc config` will reject an inconsistent or unsafe descriptor, so do not
generate parallel metadata in `emit.ts`.

## Step 2 — the hook adapter (the per-harness shim)

Core hooks consume Claude-shaped stdin as the normal form. A new harness ships
**one authored adapter** (`harness/<name>/hooks/aidlc-<name>-adapter.ts`,
listed in `harnessFiles`) that normalizes the harness's hook
payloads into that contract and subprocess-pipes to the shared core hook.
Never split a core hook into logic+adapter — the core bodies stay byte-shared
across all harnesses apart from the explicit invocation-token projection.
`--check` proves both generated forms came from the same source.

Wire the adapter to the harness's events the harness's own way: Kiro registers
targets in `agents/aidlc.json`; Codex emits `hooks.json`. Register only events
with a real core-hook consumer.

Six hooks are flow-altering and need their control channels forwarded, not
just piped. The Stop hook answers with `{"decision":"block"}` on stdout;
dispatch-rules rewrites the delegated prompt; and the PreToolUse
reviewer-scope, review-freeze, plan-approval, and state-transition guards
answer with exit 2 + a reason on stderr (the tool call must be refused when
the adapter relays that exit code). If the new harness cannot hard-block a
tool call from its pre-tool seam, leave the reviewer-scope and review-freeze
registrations out and document the gap rather than wiring dead hooks - the
prose bounds in stage-protocol-reviewer.md §12a still govern there. When the harness's
payloads carry no subagent identity, scope reviewer-scope registration to the
reviewer agents themselves where the harness supports per-agent hooks (the
Kiro CLI pattern: the adapter then asserts `scoped_registration` instead of
matching `agent_type`).

> **The one sanctioned `core/` edit: the doctor arm.** `/aidlc --doctor`
> (`core/tools/aidlc-utility.ts`) health-checks an installed tree, and a new
> harness adds a per-harness arm there for its own install surfaces (adapter +
> wiring files present, any binary-version floor). This is deliberate
> per-harness *logic*, not data — a version check spawns the CLI and compares
> semver, which no manifest row can express (the three-concerns rule: knowledge
> lives in code) — so it is the blessed exception to "zero `core/` edits", not a
> violation (a deliberate design tradeoff). It degrades gracefully: a harness with no arm simply
> gets the generic checks rather than failing. Everything else — dir resolution,
> the rules-dir rename, packaging — stays pure manifest data.

## Step 3 — `emit.ts` (the imperative 20%, only if needed)

Structural divergence a declarative row can't express is `emit.ts` — a plugin
the manifest references that the packager calls with an `EmitContext`
(`repoRoot`, `coreRoot`, `harnessRoot`, `harnessName`, `distRoot`,
`harnessDir`, channel-aware `substituteToken`, `tierCap`). The emitter writes
its outputs beneath `distRoot`. Codex's is the worked example:
`config.toml`, `hooks.json`, the hook-trust pre-seed, the native onboarding skills-path rewrite, the
agent-TOML transpositions, and the `.agents/skills/` tree (composed from
`core/tools/aidlc-runner-gen.ts`'s exported render functions under
`AIDLC_HARNESS_DIR`, never reimplemented). Harnesses whose surfaces are all
authored files (Claude, Kiro) set `emit: null`.

Under `--check`, the packager supplies two independent temporary `distRoot`
sets, runs the same emitter once per channel in each build, then compares the
two complete generated roots. Emit-owned files outside `<harnessDir>` (for
example `.agents/skills/`) therefore participate in the
same missing, differing, and orphan checks as declarative outputs. Always pass
emitted command text through `ctx.substituteToken`; otherwise an emitter can
silently put a Bun command into the native channel.

## Step 4 — the bounded transform classes

Permitted transforms are the harness/rules projection, the two invocation
tokens, declared tier/frontmatter additions, and the native host-surface
rewrites in `rewriteNativeInvocations`. That native pass updates command
allowlists, hook/adapter/statusline routes, onboarding runtime text, and native
trust entries, then rejects any surviving token or Bun invocation into an AIDLC
tool/hook. No blind `sed`. Truthful harness-specific literals in `core/` (the
`$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` note, the harness-dir enumeration in
workspace-detection) carry no token and pass through unchanged; the core-hygiene
and native-projection tests guard the boundary.

## Step 5 — tests + the gate

- A package-determinism test (`t145`) runs `package.ts --check`; it covers both
  channels for every discovered harness plus every plugin projection without
  requiring generated trees on disk.
- `t243-install-mechanism` asserts copy projections keep Bun invocations,
  release projections contain no AIDLC Bun invocation, metadata is safe and
  exhaustive, and native-only integrations appear only in `dist-release/`.
- `t238-build-binaries` compiles the native dispatcher and exercises every
  generated harness runtime without Bun on `PATH`.
- A `<name>` hook-adapter contract test pipes live-captured payloads through the
  adapter and asserts the observable core-hook effect.
- Live journeys ship as e2e gated on a `skipReason()` (a `AIDLC_<NAME>_*_LIVE=1`
  env + the binary present + authenticated) so they skip cleanly in the
  deterministic tier and run green locally before a port merges.

Run `bun scripts/package.ts <name>` to materialize both local channels,
`--check` to prove deterministic generation, and
the deterministic suite (`bash tests/run-tests.sh --smoke --unit --integration
-P 8`) plus the live journey to gate.

## Next

That closes the arc: you have shaped the data surfaces (chapters 01–08) and now
rendered the core onto a new CLI. From here:

- Back to [the Harness Engineer Guide overview](00-overview.md) for the full map.
- The new harness gets a **user-facing chapter** alongside the others — see how
  the existing ones read in the User Guide's
  [Running on other harnesses](../guide/harnesses/README.md) family.
- The normative build contract (manifest types, the `emit` plugin API, the
  `harnessDir()` seam) lives in the Developer Reference's
  [Architecture § Source vs distribution](../reference/01-architecture.md#source-vs-distribution-one-core-many-harnesses).
