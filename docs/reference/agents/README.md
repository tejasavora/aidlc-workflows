## Shared Configuration

All 15 agents share a common configuration baseline defined in their frontmatter. None declares a `tools:` allowlist, so every agent inherits the **full session toolset** — all of Claude Code's built-in tools plus any MCP tools provisioned to the session. The one shipped restriction is `disallowedTools: Task`.

### The session toolset (inherited by every agent)

Every agent inherits the built-in Claude Code tools, including:

| Claude Code Tool | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| Read | Read files from the filesystem |
| Edit | Perform exact string replacements in files |
| Write | Write files to the filesystem |
| Glob | Fast file pattern matching |
| Grep | Content search using ripgrep |
| AskUserQuestion | Interactive user prompts (main-thread stages only) |

### Common Disallowed Claude Code Tools

| Claude Code Tool | Reason |
|------------------|--------|
| Task | Agents operate as delegated workers. The conductor (the live `/aidlc` session) performs the `Task` call that runs an agent; agents themselves never spawn subagents. `disallowedTools: Task` avoids cascading subagent chains. |

### Tools each persona is expected to exercise

Every agent *can* reach Bash and WebSearch by inheritance; the table records which personas the methodology **expects** to use them, not a per-agent grant. To genuinely restrict a persona, add an optional `tools:` allowlist (which drops inherited MCP unless `mcp__<server>__<tool>` ids are also listed) — this implementation ships no such restrictions.

| Claude Code Tool | Expected to exercise it |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Bash | aidlc-aws-platform-agent, aidlc-devsecops-agent, aidlc-developer-agent, aidlc-quality-agent, aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent, aidlc-operations-agent |
| WebSearch | aidlc-product-agent, aidlc-design-agent, aidlc-compliance-agent |

### Agent Tiers

| Tier | Agents |
|------|--------|
| judgment | aidlc-architect-agent, aidlc-product-agent, aidlc-design-agent, aidlc-developer-agent, aidlc-quality-agent, aidlc-devsecops-agent, aidlc-compliance-agent, aidlc-aws-platform-agent, aidlc-composer-agent |
| balanced | aidlc-architecture-reviewer-agent, aidlc-product-lead-agent, aidlc-stage-reviewer-agent |
| templated | aidlc-delivery-agent, aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent, aidlc-operations-agent |

Every shipped agent declares a `tier:` in its authored frontmatter; the
packager projects it into each harness's native model/effort keys (on Claude
Code: judgment -> `model: inherit` with no effort pin, balanced -> `model:
sonnet` with no effort pin, templated -> `model: sonnet` + `effort: medium`).
A judgment agent is therefore never downgraded below the session's own model
and effort. An agent is templated only when its output is dominantly
pattern-following — delivery plans, CI/CD YAML, observability and runbook
scaffolding — and the methodology is already encoded in the agent's knowledge
files.

The nine judgment agents share one property: their work requires
multi-constraint reasoning whose decisions cascade downstream. Architectural
boundaries, interpretation of ambiguous intent, UX trade-offs, code synthesis
under dense context, risk-based test strategy, threat prioritisation,
regulatory edge-cases, and cloud architecture trade-offs all fall in this
category. The three balanced reviewers evaluate novel input against explicit
criteria — the checklist encodes the method, so a mid-size model at session
effort suffices. See the projection table and the `tier_cap` override in
[Agent System](../05-agent-system.md).

## Agent Comparison Matrix

`Yes` in the next two columns means the methodology expects the persona to use
that inherited tool; it does not grant or withhold access.

| Agent | Bash Expected Use | WebSearch Expected Use | Tier | Lead Stages | Support Stages | Total Stage Involvement |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------|------|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| aidlc-product-agent | No | Yes | judgment | 5 | 3 | 8 |
| aidlc-design-agent | No | Yes | judgment | 2 | 2 | 4 |
| aidlc-delivery-agent | No | No | templated | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| aidlc-architect-agent | No | No | judgment | 6 | 3 | 9 |
| aidlc-aws-platform-agent | Yes | No | judgment | 2 | 4 | 6 |
| aidlc-compliance-agent | No | Yes | judgment | 0 | 4 | 4 |
| aidlc-devsecops-agent | Yes | No | judgment | 0 | 5 | 5 |
| aidlc-developer-agent | Yes | No | judgment | 2 | 4 | 6 |
| aidlc-quality-agent | Yes | No | judgment | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| aidlc-pipeline-deploy-agent | Yes | No | templated | 4 | 0 | 4 |
| aidlc-operations-agent | Yes | No | templated | 3 | 0 | 3 |

**Observations:**
- The aidlc-architect-agent has the broadest stage involvement (9 stages across 3 phases), reflecting its role as the central design authority.
- Across the full 15-agent roster, nine agents carry the `judgment` tier and six step down (the three `balanced` reviewers plus the three `templated` planners); the stepped-down agents produce reviews against explicit checklists or dominantly templated planning, CI/CD, and runbook work. The matrix above covers the 11 domain-expert agents.
- The aidlc-compliance-agent operates purely in an advisory capacity (4 support stages across Ideation, Construction, and Operation; no lead stages).
- Six of 11 agents are expected to use Bash for CLI interaction (infrastructure, security, development, testing, deployment, operations).
- Three agents are expected to use WebSearch for research tasks (product, design, compliance).
