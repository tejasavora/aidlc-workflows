# Running on other harnesses

AI-DLC is one harness-neutral core rendered onto the CLI you use. The
methodology — the [phases and stages](../04-phases-and-stages.md), the
[agents](../06-agents.md), the [scopes](../05-scopes-and-depth.md), the
[approval gates](../07-interaction-modes.md) — is identical on every harness.
What differs is the *shell*: how gates render, how subagents are dispatched,
which session events fire, where config lives. Each chapter here covers one
harness's install steps, prerequisites, and the handful of behaviours that
differ from the neutral methodology.

Onboarding is installed in each harness's native instruction surface:

| Harness | Onboarding file |
|---------|-----------------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (full onboarding) |
| Kiro CLI and Kiro IDE | `.kiro/steering/aidlc-onboarding.md` |
| Codex CLI | `.codex/onboarding.md` (also injected through `developer_instructions` in `.codex/config.toml` when the project is trusted) |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/aidlc-onboarding.mdc` |
| opencode | `.aidlc/onboarding.md` |
| GitHub Copilot | Root `AGENTS.md` (full onboarding, including method imports) |

Kiro, Kiro IDE, Codex, Cursor, and opencode share a harness-neutral root
`AGENTS.md` block with other installed harnesses. Their native setup stays in
the files above. Copilot's full root block remains exclusive; distinct harnesses
also need distinct engine directories to coexist.

## Install first

The recommended first-run path for every harness is the checksum-verified native
installer followed by `aidlc config`:

```bash
tmp="$(mktemp -d)"
curl -fsSL \
  https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows/releases/latest/download/install.sh \
  -o "$tmp/install.sh"
sh "$tmp/install.sh"
rm -rf "$tmp"
cd your-project
aidlc config
```

The installer always includes every harness runtime. `aidlc config --harness <name>` selects the project surface. Host prerequisites still apply: Codex requires
the target project to be a Git repository for project hook discovery.

On Windows, download `install.ps1` and invoke it as
`& $installer`. See [Windows installation](../18-install-and-lifecycle.md#windows-powershell)
for account scope, automatic User PATH registration, and `-NoModifyPath`.

Pick your harness:

| Harness | Invoke | Chapter |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Claude Code** | `/aidlc` | Covered throughout the [User Guide](../00-introduction.md) (its examples run on Claude Code); install in [Getting Started](../01-getting-started.md). |
| **Kiro IDE** (≥ 1.1.70) and **Kiro CLI** (≥ 2.24.1, v3 engine) | `/aidlc` | [Running AI-DLC on Kiro IDE and Kiro CLI](kiro-ide.md) — one tree for both surfaces: prerequisites (Opus 4.8), install, hooks, what's different on Kiro. |
| **Kiro CLI** (≥ 2.6) | `/aidlc` | [Running AI-DLC on Kiro CLI](kiro-cli.md) — prerequisites, install, what's different on Kiro. |
| **Codex CLI** (≥ 0.145.0) | `$aidlc` | [AI-DLC on Codex CLI](codex-cli.md) — prerequisites, trust pre-seed, Bedrock config, the git-repo requirement. |
| **Cursor** | `/aidlc` | [AI-DLC on Cursor](cursor.md) — one tree for the Cursor IDE and CLI, native subagents and skills, the hooks.json adapter, what's different on Cursor. |
| **opencode** (≥ 1.17) | `/aidlc` | [AI-DLC on opencode](opencode.md) — the split `.aidlc/` + `.opencode/` layout, the adapter plugin, what's different on opencode. |
| **GitHub Copilot** (CLI ≥ 1.0.74 / VS Code ≥ 1.130) | `/aidlc` | [AI-DLC on GitHub Copilot](copilot.md) — one install for both surfaces, the `.github/` merge, folder trust, what's different on Copilot. |
| **Devin** (CLI + Devin Desktop) | `/aidlc` | [AI-DLC on Devin](devin.md) — one `.devin/` tree for both surfaces, the tool-name adapter, the eight hook events Devin has (and the three it lacks), what's different on Devin. |

AI-DLC on Kiro (IDE or CLI) works best with **Claude Opus 4.8**, which requires a **paid Kiro plan**.

For a manual copy, install Bun, download a specific release's
`aidlc-copy-runtime-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`, extract it, copy the complete
`runtime/<harness>/` directory, and run its own setup once (see
[Copy Channel](../18-install-and-lifecycle.md#copy-channel)); the native `aidlc`
executable is not required. A copy never replaces your `.gitignore` or
`AGENTS.md`; AI-DLC adds its own lines to them.
Do not copy generated trees from a repository checkout. Framework developers may instead run
`bun scripts/package.ts` in a source checkout to materialize the ignored local
`dist/` and `dist-release/` outputs. Each harness chapter keeps the manual-copy
instructions under a clearly labeled alternative.

After `aidlc update`, run `aidlc doctor` to see project/runtime version skew
and refresh each project with `aidlc config`. A refresh while a workflow is open
is done, says whether that work carries on, and names the command that goes
back to the earlier release.

This set is open: a new harness gets its own chapter here, added from the same
template. For *building* a new harness (the source contract — manifest, hook
adapter, `emit.ts`), see the Harness Engineer Guide's
[Porting to a New Harness](../../harness-engineering/09-porting-to-a-new-harness.md).

Whichever harness you run, the methodology is the same — start with
[Your First Workflow](../02-your-first-workflow.md) and the
[Phases and Stages](../04-phases-and-stages.md) tour.

Running a workshop or supporting a team? The
[Facilitator Guide](../facilitator-guide.md#how-strongly-each-harness-enforces-the-workflow)
compares how strongly each harness enforces the workflow, and gives a
readiness check and a recovery playbook.
