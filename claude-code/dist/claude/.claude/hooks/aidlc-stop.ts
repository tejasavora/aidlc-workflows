// Stop hook: enforce the forwarding loop on turn-end.
//
// This is the framework's FIRST flow-altering hook. The other framework
// hooks are advisory — they observe (audit, sensors, statusline, state
// validation) and always exit 0. The sensor-fire hook in particular carries
// an explicit advisory contract: it NEVER returns {decision: block} (its own
// contract, asserted by t95 Case 7 — not a framework ban). This hook is a
// DIFFERENT, sanctioned contract: it may emit {"decision":"block", ...} to
// keep the interactive forwarding loop running until the engine says `done`.
//
// Why it exists. The forwarding loop is the conductor (LLM) calling the engine
// for the next move, acting on it, and reporting. On the gated/interactive
// path the conductor holds the loop because only it can ask the human a
// question. If the conductor forgets to consult the engine — after a long
// conversation, or by improvising — the workflow drifts. So the loop cannot
// rest on the conductor's good behaviour: when the conductor tries to end its
// turn, this hook runs the engine (`aidlc-orchestrate next`) and, if a
// directive is still PENDING, blocks the stop and injects the directive back
// via `reason`. The conductor cannot quit until the engine answers `done`.
// Enforced by the harness, not by the LLM remembering.
//
// The reason is an ON-TASK CONTINUATION — it names the work the conductor
// still owes (run the loop, act on the directive, report), never an
// override-shaped instruction. That phrasing is the security property:
// override-shaped directives are refused by the conductor's own safety
// training, so a buggy or compromised engine can only ever CONTINUE sanctioned
// work, never hijack the session.
//
// Two bounds keep a stuck loop from trapping the session (a stuck block is the
// ONE way to trap a session, so this is the safety-critical part):
//   1. `stop_hook_active` — Claude Code sets this true when the current stop is
//      itself the product of a prior Stop-hook block. We read it as a signal
//      that we are already inside a blocked sequence.
//   2. A NO-PROGRESS counter — consecutive blocks with no intervening workflow
//      advance (no `report` ran, so the position signature is unchanged). It is
//      persisted across the rapid-fire blocks in a transient file under
//      aidlc-docs/.aidlc-stop-hook/. Under an 8-block ceiling exposed as
//      CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP (default 8), once the count reaches the
//      cap we LET GO (allow the stop). When the workflow advances, the signature
//      changes and the counter resets to 0, so a healthy loop is never throttled.
//
// The human-stop carve-out is FREE: Stop hooks do not fire on user interrupt
// (Esc), so an Esc can never be trapped — no code needed here.
//
// No-op outside AIDLC. The frontmatter Stop matcher scopes this to the `aidlc`
// skill, but we defend here too: with no active workflow (no aidlc-state.md
// under the project dir) we exit 0 immediately. A non-AIDLC session is NEVER
// blocked. Any unexpected error also falls through to allow the stop — failing
// open is the only safe failure mode for a hook that can otherwise trap a turn.
