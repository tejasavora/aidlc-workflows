# AI-DLC — AI-Driven Development Life Cycle

Run **`/aidlc`** to start or resume a workflow. Describe what to build and the scope is
auto-detected. In Devin Cloud, `@skills:aidlc` also works.

Every stage stops at an approval gate. Nothing advances without your decision.

## Prerequisites

- **bun**: required for the CLI tools and hook scripts (state, audit log, sensors,
  orchestration). Install with `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`; on Windows
  `npm install -g bun`. It must be on your PATH for **non-interactive** shells, so put the
  export in `~/.zshenv` (zsh) or `~/.bashrc` (bash) — NOT `~/.zshrc`. Check with `which bun`.
- **A git repository**: the workflow records state and uses worktrees for Construction.
- **Locking**: Audit log file locking is handled portably using mkdir-based locking in the system temp directory (no external dependencies).
- **Hook permissions**: All 16 hooks are TypeScript (`.ts`) and run via `bun`. No executable bits required — works identically on macOS, Linux, and native Windows PowerShell.
- **Permission prompts**: Devin scopes an `Exec` grant to the *wrapped program*, so
  `bun .devin/tools/aidlc-orchestrate.ts` is approved separately from other
  scripts. Expect several approvals on the first run; approving each once is enough.
  `--permission-mode accept-edits` reduces prompting in a workspace you trust.
- **Hooks**: wired in `.devin/hooks.v1.json`. Verify with `/hooks` in the
  terminal, or **Open customizations** in Devin Desktop (`/hooks` is not available over
  the IDE's agent protocol).

## What AI-DLC does for you

AI-DLC walks a piece of work from idea to shipped code in ordered steps, and
stops to ask you for approval at each one. You describe what you want built; it
works out how much process the change needs, asks the questions it actually
needs answered, writes the design and code, and keeps a written record of what
was decided and why. Nothing advances past a step without your say-so, and you
can change the plan, the depth, or the direction at any approval point.

The sections below describe where it keeps things in this project. You do not
need to read them to start: run the command in the header above and answer the
questions.

## AI-DLC Structure

- **Skill**: `.devin/skills/aidlc/` — Orchestrator (`SKILL.md`), stage protocol, and the stage files across the phase directories (the enabled set depends on the composed plugins: see the compiled `.devin/tools/data/stage-graph.json` or run `/aidlc --doctor`)
- **Session skills** (read-only, user-invocable): `.devin/skills/aidlc-session-cost/`, `.devin/skills/aidlc-replay/`, `.devin/skills/aidlc-outcomes-pack/` — typed as `/aidlc-session-cost`, `/aidlc-replay`, `/aidlc-outcomes-pack`. Each pulls every count from `bun .devin/tools/aidlc-runtime.ts summary --json` (no LLM-side counting). Classified `read-only`: they never advance the workflow stage pointer and never emit audit events. `aidlc-session-cost` and `aidlc-replay` print to the terminal only; `aidlc-outcomes-pack` is the only one that writes a file (`OUTCOMES.md`).
- **Stage-runner skills** (user-invocable): `.devin/skills/aidlc-<stage>/` — one per runnable core stage, typed as `/aidlc-<stage>` (e.g. `/aidlc-domain-design`, `/aidlc-code-generation`); plugin-owned stages use their bare plugin-prefixed command name. Each runs that single stage in isolation via the engine's `--single` mode (`aidlc-orchestrate next --stage <slug> --single`) and **never advances your main workflow's `Current Stage`** — a single-stage run is isolated by design (the tool refuses to advance the main workflow). They are opt-in packaging: the same stage is reachable via `/aidlc --stage <slug> --single` without a runner. The runner set is generated from the compiled stage graph by `bun .devin/tools/aidlc-runner-gen.ts write` and kept in sync by its `check` drift guard, so adding a stage file and regenerating adds its runner. The three bootstrap **initialization** stages ship no per-stage runner (they have no standalone meaning); the whole initialization phase is packaged as `/aidlc-init`, which creates the first workflow record and its starting state in one step. (This is opt-in packaging: describing what to build normally sets up the first piece of work by itself — no separate initialization command is needed.)
- **Agents**: `.devin/agents/` — the base framework ships 14 agents: 11 domain-expert personas (product, design, delivery, architect, aws-platform, compliance, devsecops, developer, quality, pipeline-deploy, operations), 2 review-only agents (product-lead, architecture-reviewer), and the adaptive-workflows composer. A plugin install may add more; the enabled set is discovered from the files present under that directory. Each persona carries an explicit `model:`. Devin runs a custom subagent profile on its
*default subagent model* when `model:` is absent — not on the session model — so the tier
is projected to an explicit model name at build time.

**`ask_user_question` is withheld from Devin subagents**, so any stage where a persona
must interrogate you runs INLINE in the root agent rather than being delegated.
- **Method/rules**: `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/memory/` — Layered files authored once at the workspace root, read by each harness via its native include (Claude `@`-import stub, Kiro CLI resources or IDE steering, Codex `AIDLC_RULES_DIR`, opencode `instructions` glob, Copilot `AGENTS.md` `@`-imports; no copy into `.devin/`): `org.md` (framework defaults + organisation-wide guardrails), `team.md` (this team's affirmed practices), `project.md` (project-specific specialisation), plus `phases/<phase>.md` for ideation, inception, construction, and operation (initialization is bootstrap-only and ships no rule file). Resolution is a strict-additive five-layer chain — `org → team → project → phase → stage` — where every applicable rule appears in `rules_in_context` at runtime. Conflicts (narrower contradicting broader policy) are rejected at the §13 learning admission check before the learning reaches disk. See `docs/reference/01-architecture.md` § "Configuration layers" and `docs/reference/08-rule-system.md` for the schema.
- **Sensors**: `.devin/sensors/`: automatic checks that run against what gets written (they report, they never block). Ships with framework defaults (`aidlc-claim-sources.md`, `aidlc-required-sections.md`, `aidlc-upstream-coverage.md`, `aidlc-traceability.md`, `aidlc-linter.md`, `aidlc-type-check.md`); forks may add custom `aidlc-<id>.md` manifests. Stages declare which sensors fire via the frontmatter `sensors: [<id>]` list — a pull import resolved at compile time. The PostToolUse hook reads the compile-resolved `sensors_applicable` array off the stage graph node.
- **Knowledge**: `.devin/knowledge/` — Methodology reference. Per-agent under `aidlc-<agent>-agent/` subfolders; `aidlc-shared/` holds cross-agent material. Ships with framework.
- **Team Knowledge**: `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/knowledge/` — User-managed team and domain knowledge, a space-level sibling of `memory/`/`codekb/`/`intents/` that accumulates across every intent in the space. Free-form and empty at bootstrap (no fixed file set, no seeded READMEs); the engine ensure-exists the empty dir on your first `/aidlc`. Agents read `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/knowledge/aidlc-shared/` (all agents) and `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/knowledge/<agent>/` (that agent) if the team creates them.
- **Tools**: `.devin/tools/`: small command-line programs (TypeScript, run via bun) that do the parts which must be exact rather than judged: tracking where the workflow is, writing the decision log, deciding what runs next (`aidlc-orchestrate.ts`, with exactly four subcommands: `next`, `continue`, `report`, and `park`; `continue` is internal steering transport), running the automatic checks, recording what the team learned (`aidlc-learnings.ts`), and refereeing parallel Construction work (`aidlc-swarm.ts`). All framework files prefixed `aidlc-*.ts`.
- **Hooks**: `.devin/hooks/`: scripts your CLI runs automatically at set moments, so the decision log, saved progress, and status display stay correct without anyone remembering to update them. All framework files prefixed `aidlc-*.ts`.

## Plugins

AI-DLC is open-world. Plugins under `plugins/<name>/` contribute additional stages, scopes, and agents, and `select-plugins` chooses which are enabled in this install. The counts above describe the base framework; your enabled set may differ. The compiled `.devin/tools/data/stage-graph.json` and `/aidlc --doctor` are the authoritative live view of what is enabled here.

- **Hook config**: `.devin/hooks.v1.json` — Devin's hook wiring. The hooks object
  is the entire file (no wrapper key). A single adapter,
  `.devin/hooks/aidlc-devin-adapter.ts`, translates Devin's lowercase tool names
  (`exec`, `edit`, `run_subagent`) into the names the core hook bodies compare against,
  then hands off unchanged — Devin's stdin/stdout envelopes and its "exit 2 blocks, reason
  on stderr" convention already match.
## Conventions

- All artifacts go under the active intent's record dir — `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/intents/<slug>-<id8>/` (shorthand `<record>/`) — beneath the neutral `aidlc/` workspace roof; application code goes to the workspace root (or a sibling repo). Single-team users only ever see `spaces/default/`.
- Each stage keeps an observation diary at `<record>/<phase>/<stage>/memory.md`, auto-created from a template at stage start and kept up to date automatically as the stage runs, never hand-edited
- Use emojis as defined in skill/stage files — reproduce them exactly
- Validate Mermaid diagram syntax before writing; include text fallback
- Validate all generated content for character escaping issues

## Documentation

For full documentation, see `docs/guide/` (User Guide), `docs/harness-engineering/` (Harness Engineer Guide), and `docs/reference/` (Developer Reference); start at `docs/README.md`.
## The AI-DLC method

The method is authored once at the workspace root and is identical on every harness.
**Read these before acting on a development request**, and re-read the phase file when a
workflow enters a new phase:

@aidlc/spaces/default/memory/org.md
@aidlc/spaces/default/memory/team.md
@aidlc/spaces/default/memory/project.md
@aidlc/spaces/default/memory/phases/ideation.md
@aidlc/spaces/default/memory/phases/inception.md
@aidlc/spaces/default/memory/phases/construction.md
@aidlc/spaces/default/memory/phases/operation.md

Resolution is strict-additive: `org → team → project → phase → stage`. A narrower layer
specialises a broader one; it never contradicts it.

> Devin has no file-include mechanism inside a rule, so the lines above NAME the method
> rather than embedding it — the agent must open them. An AI-DLC stage does not depend on
> this: the engine resolves the same tree directly.
## Session Resumption

On startup, resolve the active intent (the `aidlc/spaces/<active-space>/intents/active-intent` cursor) and check for its `<record>/aidlc-state.md`. If found, load prior context and offer to resume from last checkpoint. (A brand-new project has no work recorded yet; the first `/aidlc` creates that record for you.)
## Known limits on this harness

Devin's hook surface covers most of the framework, but not all of it. These gaps are real
and are not worked around:

- **No per-subagent completion event.** Devin has no `SubagentStop`, so per-subagent
  tracking does not fire and subagent activity is not individually audited.
- **Compaction is observed after the fact.** Devin has `PostCompaction` but no
  `PreCompact`, so state validation runs *after* a compaction and cannot inspect or veto
  one. Nothing fires if a compaction fails.
- **Restricted Mode disables everything, silently.** A workspace open in Restricted Mode
  has all agents *and* all hooks disabled. That is indistinguishable from a broken
  install — check workspace trust first.
- **Devin Cloud is partial.** Cloud has no repo-level hooks, no subagents, and allows only
  one active skill at a time, so the orchestrator cannot dispatch stage skills there.
  Cloud also needs a blueprint `initialize:` step and a snapshot build before `bun` exists.

Where a hook is absent, gate discipline is a human responsibility.
## Git Integration

Commit the `aidlc/` workspace tree — the record (state, the per-clone audit shards under `<record>/audit/`, `intents.json`), memory, codekb, and knowledge are all version-controlled. The shipped `.gitignore` excludes the per-user cursors and machine-local runtime (these may be per-clone or contain sensitive data):
- `aidlc/active-space` and `aidlc/spaces/*/intents/active-intent` (per-user cursors)
- `aidlc/.aidlc-clone-id` (per-clone audit-shard token) and `aidlc/.aidlc-sessions/`
- `aidlc/spaces/*/intents/.aidlc-*` (pre-intent hooks-health scratch)
- `aidlc/spaces/*/intents/*/runtime-graph.json` (also covers per-Bolt worktree fragments by relative-path glob)
- `aidlc/spaces/*/intents/*/.aidlc-*` (recovery, hooks-health, sensors scratch)
