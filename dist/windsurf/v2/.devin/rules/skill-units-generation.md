# Units Generation

Decompose the system into manageable units of work. A unit of work is a logical grouping of stories for development purposes. For microservices, each unit becomes an independently deployable service. For monoliths, the single unit represents the entire application with logical modules. Cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, error handling) form their own unit, built first so others can depend on it.

## Prerequisites

- `requirements.md` must be approved
- `stories.md` and `personas.md` must be approved
- `components.md`, `component-methods.md`, `component-dependencies.md`, `services.md`, `cross-cutting.md` must be approved (application-design is required — it determines components, methods, and services that get grouped into units)
- If wireframes ran: `screen-structure.md` should be available (informs frontend unit organisation)
- If brownfield, brownfield context must be available

## Input

- `requirements.md`
- `stories.md`, `personas.md`
- `components.md`, `component-methods.md`, `component-dependencies.md`, `services.md`, `cross-cutting.md` (from application-design)
- `screen-structure.md` (if present — from wireframes, informs frontend unit boundaries)
- Brownfield context (if applicable)

## Question Guidance

Focus clarifying questions on:

- How should stories be grouped into units — by domain boundary, by deployment independence, by team ownership, or by feature area?
- What are the integration patterns between units — synchronous calls, async events, shared data stores?
- Are there team structure or ownership constraints that should influence unit boundaries?
- Do different parts of the system have different scalability or deployment requirements that warrant separate units?
- Are there clear bounded contexts in the business domain that map to natural unit boundaries?
- Should cross-cutting concerns (from `cross-cutting.md`) be a dedicated shared/platform unit, or embedded within each unit? (Recommend: dedicated unit built first, others depend on it.)
- (Greenfield multi-unit only) What is the deployment model — microservices with independent deployables, or a monolith with logical modules? What directory structure is preferred?
- (If `screen-structure.md` present) Should frontend screen groups map to separate units, or should all frontend live in one unit?

## Output

Three mandatory artifacts:

### units-of-work.md

One section per unit. Each includes:

- **Name** — unit identifier
- **Type** — service (independently deployable) or module (logical grouping within a service)
- **Purpose** — what this unit does
- **Responsibilities** — what it is accountable for
- **Components** — which components from `components.md` belong to this unit
- **Stories** — which story IDs (`S-<n>`) this unit implements (includes both primary-owned and contributing stories)
- **Code organization strategy** (greenfield only) — directory structure for this unit

### units-of-work-dependency.md

Dependency matrix between units:

- Unit A → Unit B: communication pattern (sync call, async event, shared data)
- Rationale for each dependency
- Build/deployment order implications
- Circular dependencies must be listed with explicit justification

### units-of-work-story-map.md

Complete mapping of every story to units. Format:

- **Story ID** — `S-<n>`
- **Primary unit** — the unit that owns the story's acceptance criteria and is responsible for its completion
- **Contributing units** — other units that participate in fulfilling the story (may be empty)
- **Rationale** — why this assignment was made

Every story from `stories.md` must appear. Every story must have exactly one primary unit. A story may have zero or more contributing units. Cross-cutting stories (e.g. system-wide error handling) typically have the cross-cutting/platform unit as primary, with all other units as contributing.

## Validation

Validation rules for this skill's output live in `validation-spec.md` at the skill root. See `aidlc-common/protocols/aidlc-validator-protocol.md` for how they are applied.
