# Build and Test

**Purpose**: Build all units, execute tests, fix issues, and verify the complete system works.

This stage has TWO modes:
- **Execute Mode** (preferred): Actually run build, test, and deployment commands. Fix errors iteratively until everything passes.
- **Instructions Mode** (fallback): Generate instruction documents for the user to execute manually. Use this only if the platform does not support command execution.

**Default to Execute Mode.** Only fall back to Instructions Mode if command execution is not available.

## Prerequisites
- Code Generation must be complete for all units (including per-unit build verification in Step 17 of code-generation)
- All code artifacts must be generated
- Project is ready for full build and testing

---

## EXECUTE MODE

### Step E1: Full Build
- [ ] Run dependency installation across all units (e.g., `npm install`)
- [ ] Run full build (e.g., `npm run build`, `tsc --noEmit`, `mvn compile`)
- [ ] If build fails:
  1. Read error output
  2. Fix compilation errors
  3. Rebuild
  4. Repeat up to 3 times
- [ ] If build still fails after 3 attempts: present errors to user

### Step E2: Run All Unit Tests
- [ ] Run test suite (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`, `mvn test`)
- [ ] If tests fail:
  1. Analyze failure output
  2. Fix failing code or tests
  3. Re-run tests
  4. Repeat up to 3 times
- [ ] Report: total tests, passed, failed, coverage percentage

### Step E3: Run Linting and Static Analysis
- [ ] Run linter (e.g., `npm run lint`, `eslint`, `flake8`)
- [ ] Fix any linting errors
- [ ] Run security audit (e.g., `npm audit`, `pip audit`, `mvn dependency-check:check`)
- [ ] Report any high/critical vulnerabilities

### Step E4: Deploy (Requires User Approval)

**APPROVAL GATE**: Ask user before deploying.

- [ ] Ask user: "Build and tests pass. Do you want to deploy to AWS? This will create real cloud resources."
- [ ] If approved:
  1. Synthesize IaC (e.g., `npx cdk synth`)
  2. Show diff (e.g., `npx cdk diff`)
  3. Deploy (e.g., `npx cdk deploy --all --require-approval broadening`)
  4. If deployment fails: read errors, fix IaC code, retry up to 2 times
  5. Report deployed resources and stack outputs
- [ ] If declined: Skip deployment, note in summary

### Step E5: Run Integration Tests (If Deployed)
- [ ] If deployment succeeded:
  1. Extract API endpoint URL from stack outputs
  2. Run integration test commands (curl, httpie, or test scripts)
  3. Test key scenarios: health check, CRUD operations, auth enforcement
  4. Report results
- [ ] If not deployed: Generate integration test instructions for manual execution

### Step E6: Present Results

Present actual results (not templates):

```markdown
# 🔨 Build and Test Complete!

**Build**: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
**Unit Tests**: X passed, Y failed (Z% coverage)
**Lint**: ✅ CLEAN / ❌ X issues
**Security Audit**: ✅ No vulnerabilities / ⚠️ X findings
**Deployment**: ✅ Deployed / ⏭️ Skipped
**Integration Tests**: ✅ X/Y passed / ⏭️ Not run
```

---

## INSTRUCTIONS MODE (Fallback)

Use this mode only if the platform does not support command execution. Generate instruction documents for the user to execute manually.

### Step 1: Analyze Testing Requirements

Analyze the project to determine appropriate testing strategy:
- **Unit tests**: Already generated per unit during code generation
- **Integration tests**: Test interactions between units/services
- **Performance tests**: Load, stress, and scalability testing
- **End-to-end tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Contract tests**: API contract validation between services
- **Security tests**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
